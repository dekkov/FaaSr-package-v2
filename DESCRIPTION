Description: Provides a local execution environment for testing and developing 'FaaSr' workflows
    without requiring cloud infrastructure. The 'FaaSr-Local' package enables R developers to
    validate and test workflows locally before deploying to Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platforms.
    Key features include:
    1) Parsing and validating JSON workflow configurations compliant with the 'FaaSr' schema
    2) Simulated S3 storage operations using local filesystem with local logging
    3) Support for conditional branching
    4) Support for parallel rank functions execution
    5) Workflow cycle detection and validation
    6) No cloud credentials or infrastructure required for testing
    This package is designed for development and testing purposes. For production deployment
    to cloud FaaS platforms, use the main 'FaaSr' package available at
    <https://faasr.io/>.
